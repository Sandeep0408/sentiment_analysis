#Commit_change_1
CNN Model finetuned and achieved accuracy of 96% on test dataset
BERT MODEL finetuned and achieved accuracy of 92% on test dataset

#Commit_change_2
CNN & BERT model trained on new dataset, CNN acheived an accuracy of 90% whereas BERT had an accuracy of 94%.
Both notebooks uploaded to git 
 
#Commit_change_3
LSTM code fixed, below parameters updated to improve accuracy from 80% to 95%
	1) Changing weights from 2.45,0.62 to 3.33,1.43 for label0 (i.e. negative) and label1 (i.e. positive) respectively. 
	2) Changing batch size from 30 to 128
LSTM trained on new dataset, accuracy recorded is 88%
